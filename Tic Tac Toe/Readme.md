## Multiplayer[1]

This mode allows two individuals to play against each other. Players take turns clicking on the empty cells of the 
game board to place their respective symbols (X or O). The game checks for a winning condition or a draw after each 
move and announces the winner (Player 1 or Player 2) or a draw accordingly.

## Single Player - Easy Mode[2]:
In this mode, the player faces off against a computer opponent that makes random moves. The player goes first, clicking on an empty cell to place an X. The computer then randomly selects an empty cell to place an O. The game continues until there's a winner, a draw, or the player decides to exit. The computer in this mode does not make strategic moves and just picks available cells at random.

##  Single Player - Medium Mode[3]:
In this mode, the player challenges a slightly smarter computer opponent. Similar to Easy Mode, the player starts by placing an X in an empty cell. However, the computer now employs a basic strategy to determine its moves. It tries to block the player from forming a winning line while also attempting to create its own winning line. 
The player has a chance to win, but they need to be careful to avoid falling into the computer's traps.

## Single Player - Hard Mode[4]:
This mode offers a significant challenge to the player. The computer opponent is designed to ensure either a draw or a win. The player places an X in an empty cell, 
and the computer responds with an O in a way that prevents the player from winning if possible. 

## Exit:
Clicking any other key besides 1, 2, 3, or 4 allows the user to exit the game. This option is provided to give players the ability to leave the game at any time and return to the menu.
